# img_samples

Sample input/output directories for reproducible runs.

- `img_samples/in/`  — input tiles/images the host will ingest
- `img_samples/out/` — processed outputs written by the host

You can place any binary data here (e.g., raw RGB, JPEG, PNG). For performance testing,
prefer uniformly sized tiles to keep measurements consistent.
